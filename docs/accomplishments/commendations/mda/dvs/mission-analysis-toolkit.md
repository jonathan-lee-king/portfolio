# Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Advanced Concepts and Performance Assessments (DVS)

Received commendation at MDA All Hands ceremony in 2016/early 2017 for significant contributions in streamlining the flight test process for CTV-02+.

*I was unable to attend due to changing jobs and no longer having Redstone Arsenal access.  However, I had colleagues reach out to tell me.  Additionally, I saw the MDA slide deck with my name on it.*

```markdown
To the Men and Women of the Missile Defense Agency:

We took time on Monday to ***give special recognition to individuals and teams who have excelled in their jobs and truly made a difference within the Agency***.  I would like to recognize ***a few additional individuals for their outstanding achievements to both the Agency and their organizations***.

Janet Fisher and the Advanced Concept Assessment Analysis Team in DV have ***distinguished themselves with their outstanding work*** to prepare for, execute, and analyze the results from our Reaper campaign during the January GM controlled test vehicle flight test (CTV-02+).  Their work is establishing the analytical and empirical evidence necessary for us to expand the sensor grid options we can provide to the warfighter in the future.

I would also like to recognize Jay Delduco of MDA's General Law Division.
Jay is the lead counsel for much of our litigation and represents MDA in personnel appeals in Federal Court and before the Merit Systems Protection Board.  Jay recently persuaded the Merit Systems Protection Board to find in favor of MDA and uphold MDA's action to suspend an employee's access to classified information based upon employee's conduct, benefiting both MDA and the entire Department of Defense.

Ron Huskey and Gary Foster of QS have been selected by the Program Lead Production, Quality, and Manufacturing (PQM) Key Leadership Position (KLP) Joint Qualification Board to fill DoD PQM Key Leadership Positions.  They were the only personnel selected from within the pool of DoD qualified candidates by the PQM KLP Board this year.

Both Gina Gilbertson (Mission Director) and Nick Liberatore (Mission Test Director) from DT should be recognized for their efforts in ensuring the successful execution of Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GM) Controlled Test Vehicle (CTV)-02+.  This test was a key step in meeting the Secretary of Defense's mandate for the deployment of 44 GBIs by the end of 2017.  While this was a true team effort, Gina and Nick distinguished themselves by overcoming numerous technical and programmatic challenges, routinely interfacing with executive leadership, and keeping a large and diverse team on track.

Please join me in congratulating these individuals for the exemplary work on behalf of the missile defense mission.

I am honored every day to serve with you.

***VADM Jim Syring***
