# Missile Defense Agency (MDA) THAAD Project Office (TPO)

- Eric Lewis (software lead/scrum master/product owner) received praise for my efforts during a sprint review in 2017.
- Earned exceptional customer praise for engineering a parsing and transformation solution that extracted, reshaped, and populated data into the Task Allocation Matrix, enabling critical analysis and issue resolution.
  - This ETL process had previously been deemed ***impossible*** by the customer.
- This verbal commendation shows I can work directly with leadership to reach *"unreachable"* goals.
